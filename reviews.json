      "profile_summary": "Dr. Mrittunjoy Guha Majumdar, Assistant Professor (Selection Grade) jointly appointed by the School of Computing Sciences and Advanced Engineering, currently leads the Centre for Excellence for Quantum Technology at UPES, Dehradun. Having completed his doctorate from the renowned Cavendish Laboratory at the University of Cambridge, he has been a Postdoctoral Fellow at Harvard University, a senior postdoctoral researcher at the Indian Institute of Science \u2013 Bangalore (funded by the Office of the Principal Scientific Advisor to the Government of India), and a postdoctoral associate of Nobel Laureate (Physics, 1973) Prof. Brian Josephson at the University of Cambridge. He has been a Trinity Barlow Scholar (2015-2018), Nehru Scholar (2014-2018), Inspire Scholar (2011-2014) and TIFR (Tata Institute of Fundamental Research) NIUS Fellow (2012-2014). He has been a lead speaker at the National Quantum Mission strategic consultations on Quantum Error Correction and Quantum Error Mitigation. He has had training in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning from the MIT Schwarzmann School of Computing. Dr. Guha Majumdar has been highlighted by UNESCO twice, in its documentary screened at the Global Convention on Higher Education 2018 and as the lead of the Drafting and Organization Committees for the NGO-UNESCO Position Paper on Youth and Advocacy 2021. He has chaired a C20 session on Education and Technology, besides having his position paper on technological interventions for pedagogical innovations forwarded by the C20 Secretariat to the G20 2023. Previously, he worked with the Ministry of Human Resource Development (MHRD), Government of India, on competency-based learning, differentiated curriculum and experiential learning, submitting a report that fed into the formulation of the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020. He has been a science communicator, with his documentary on Quantum Mechanics aired on Door Darshan, under the Science India initiative. He is the national convenor of Mandala, Vijnana Bharati, and previously a member of the Academic Standards and Enhancement Committee (ASEC) of the University of Cambridge.",
      "work_experience": "Currently working as Assistant Profesor (Selection Grade) in the School of Computer Science and Advanced Engineering, UPES.Before joining UPES, he worked as an assistant professor in the Department of Physics, Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham and a Postdoctoral Fellow at Harvard University from 2022 to 2023. He also worked as a Senior Postdoctoral Researcher at the Indian Institute of Science from 2021 to 2022 and as a Guest Faculty at the Department of Physics, University of Delhi from 2020 to 2021. Also, Institute Postdoctoral Fellow at Tata Institute of Fundamental Research from 2020 to 2021, and a Postdoctoral Affiliate at Trinity College, University of Cambridge from 2019 to 2020. He also served as a Committee Member at the University Standards and Enhancement Committee (ASEC), University Research Ethics Committee (UREC), Environmental Sustainability Strategy Committee (ESSC), University of Cambridge in 2019, Secretary, BlueSci at Science Magazine of Cambridge University from 2017 to 2019, Research Assistant at Saha Institute of Nuclear Physics in 2014, Associated Researcher at Solid State Physics Laboratory (SSPL), Defence Research and Development Organization (DRDO) in 2013, and Research Assistant at IIT, Guwahati, 2012.",
      "research_interests": "Dr. Mrittunjoy Guha Majumdar centres his research on non-classical correlations, particularly higher-dimensional entanglement, and its deployment in quantum information processing, with a special focus on quantum error mitigation. He has a broader interest in the physics of information, having analysed the intersection of entropy, info-dynamics, and even biological systems, in the past. Within quantum information processing, he has been working on the generation, characterization, and application of entanglement, within and across transverse degrees of freedom in condensed matter (particularly silicon heterostructure-based) and optical (cascaded hyper-conditional) systems. At IISc (Indian Institute of Science), besides working on Quantum Transduction (on a project of national strategic importance, under the Office of the Principal Scientific Advisor to the Government of India) he also worked on quantum network coding (particularly with network operation retrievability upon node failure with butterfly-network analogues in the quantum domain) and quantum random walks. He has previously worked on quantum superdense coding, quantum teleportation, entanglement monogamy, quantum secret sharing, quantum key distribution, quantum memory and quantum communication protocols.",
      "teaching_philosophy": "The teaching philosophy of Dr Guha revolves around nurturing constructive reflexivity and multidimensional, multidisciplinary human resource development in students. With the challenge within higher education now shifting to both access as well as quality control, he can bring insight from his work with the Academic Standards and Enhancement Committee (ASEC) at the University of Cambridge as well as the Ministry of Human Resource Development, Government of India, to instantiate academic rigour and pedagogical innovations. At UPES, he is working towards establishing competency-based learning, emphasizing critical reasoning, design thinking, and experiential training. His approach involves regular testing on higher-order thinking (having introduced the novel element of Open ChatGPT tests, like the Cambridge TRIPOS), self-diagnostic testing frameworks, interdisciplinary learning, and encouraging students to explore research frontiers.",
