       "  'research_interests': 'Dr. Roychowdhury conducts research in mathematical physics, less conventional “physical mathematics” would be even a better wording. Physics often advances when crisp mathematical structures are uncovered in a framework developed to describe observed phenomena. For example, in quantum gravity there is a vast discrepancy between the current calculational difficulty in making predictions for experiments and the simple, elegant mathematical form of the result. The emergent gravity program seeks to explain and exploit this surprising simplicity by reformulating the basic mathematical tools used to make predictions about large scale background independent structure of spacetime. During past few years, Roychowdhury started developing the formalism of emergent gravity which naturally admits a generalized geometric structure and hence is very similar to the Double Field Theory formalism that was recently invoked by Hull and Zwiebach, in spirit. The research proposal that he is planning to undertake at UPES encompasses various arenas of physics and mathematics namely emergent theory of gravity, duality, diffeomorphism, noncommutative geometry, category theory, differential geometry of bundle gerbes, cohomology theory and is aimed at studying the interplay between Gerbes, topological T-duality and automorphisms of Emergent gravity. The goal of the program is to find a topological T-dual avatar of this gravity theory. His other research interests are integrable systems, holographic methods in condensed matter physics, Extremal Black Holes in Supergravity and Attractor Mechanism, Kahler Einstein metrics, Seiberg-Witten theory and SYZ Mirror symmetry, Symplectic to multisymplectic generalization, Generalized Darboux formalism and Fedosov quantization.',\n",
       "  'teaching_philosophy': 'Learning Physics can be a wonderfully rich experience. Of all the course a student might take during his/her university career, he believes physics offers some of the greatest potential for overall intellectual development. On one hand, it can describe and explain a wide variety of specific real-world phenomena, while on the other, it requires the use of more general intellectual processes such as abstraction, conceptualization, and logical reasoning that form the building blocks of a mature, thoughtful worldview. Unfortunately, many high school students fail to appreciate and value the riches physics and mathematics can offer them. This may be due to several factors, including poor experiences in past classes, a tendency to take math and physics only because it is required, and a more general feeling in society that they are simply “hard’’ and anyway unnecessary to really learn well. But whatever the cause, he believes, his role as an instructor will be to respond to this situation by firstly motivating students to see physical and mathematical concepts as being worthy of their effort, secondly communicating those concepts during class time in a clear and engaging manner, and last but not the least, facilitating the retainment of those ideas and concepts through classroom organization and appropriate technological tools. Dr. Roychowdhury strongly believes that physics, like any other natural science, cannot exist in isolation, and can only live through an active exchange of ideas between the people who pursue it. Since an important segment of the physics community are the students learning it, teaching is one of the most important components of the process of doing physics. As a physicist, he is motivated not only by the sheer pleasure of finding things out, but also explaining them to others. He receives a great deal of intellectual pleasure from explaining physical concepts and witnessing students understand them. He feels that it is essential to keep students involved in the subject and convey to them not just the information but the concepts and thought processes that make up the crux of the subject. In a nutshell, the art of teaching to him, is the art of assisting discovery.',\n",

Navigating through two major crises – the Asian financial collapse and SARS in Hong Kong, gave me the opportunity to face disruption, and constructively carve success stories where none seemed possible. That experience has come in handy. I constantly challenge MBA students to look at problems from different angles and explore creative solutions. I enjoy the vibrancy and energy at the campus, as well as the opportunity to grow the management discipline of Strategy into a demanding yet enjoyable and rewarding career. The best reward came from my students, who awarded me 4.9/5 in a survey a few months earlier. What more can I ask for? Sure, the next best reward would be to see my students in top leadership positions in the coming years.\",\n",

Foxo1 was required for the induction of IL-9 with concomitant suppression of IL-17; inhibition of AKT enhanced the Foxo1-mediated development of Th9 cells. Given the proinflammatory functions of Th9 cells in allergic inflammation, autoimmunity, and tumor immunity, the identification of Foxo1 as a key transcription factor that dictates the development and effector functions of Th9 and IL-9-producing T cells could prove beneficial in designing targeted therapies aimed at alleviating the course of autoimmune diseases and anti-cancer therapy.',\n",

South Asian cinema for instance – although not homogenous in itself – brings to the fore a revolutionary new aesthetic, hitherto considered outside the realms of scholarly engagement owing to the largely Eurocentric conception of form and aesthetic.

One of the ways in which this is possible is through an engagement with the question of “marginality” in cinema which remains a site of, on the one hand, the perpetuation of marginalities but also a space for dissent and decentring of the discourse on marginality and the marginalized.',\n",
